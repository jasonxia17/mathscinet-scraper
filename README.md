# mathscinet-scraper

### Setup and Running the Code
Clone this repository and `cd` into the repository folder. Then, run the following commands:
```
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver_manager
python3 scraper.py
```

### Example Output
See `output.txt` for an example output when this script is run on the UIUC math department's faculty list.

### Notes
You need to manually log in when the Shibboleth page appears. If you don't log in within 60 seconds, the script will time out and crash.

To use this script on a different department/school's faculty list, you need to change `FACULTY_LIST_URL` to the appropriate website, and you need to change `CSS_SELECTOR` based on the structure of that website's HTML. It might take a bit of trial and error to find a selector that works properly.
